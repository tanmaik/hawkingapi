Microbes inhabit just about every part of the human body, living on the skin, in the gut, and up the nose. 
Sometimes they cause sickness, but most of the time, microorganisms live in harmony with their human hosts, 
providing vital functions essential for human survival. For the first time, a consortium of researchers 
organized by the National Institutes of Health has mapped the normal microbial makeup of healthy humans, 
producing numerous insights and even a few surprises. Researchers found, for example, that nearly everyone 
routinely carries pathogens, microorganisms known to cause illnesses. In healthy individuals, however, pathogens 
cause no disease; they simply coexist with their host and the rest of the human microbiome, the collection of 
all microorganisms living in the human body. Researchers must now figure out why some pathogens turn deadly and 
under what conditions, likely revising current concepts of how microorganisms cause disease.
